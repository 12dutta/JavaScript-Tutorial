// console.log(2 >= 1);

// console.log(2 == 1);

// This were are simple comparision becoz they have numbers only at both positions


// console.log("2" > 1);
// console.log("02" > 1);

console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0);
// But in this types of comparision when string and numbers or string and boolean compare then there is difficult to solve

// In most of the case this type of comparision were ignored becoz we want a readable code to present
// **Clean code has more value then usual

console.log(undefined == 0);
console.log(undefined > 0);
console.log(undefined < 0);

// === 

console.log("2" === 2);
